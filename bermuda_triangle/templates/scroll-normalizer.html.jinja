{% block description %}
  <p>
    This tiny tool modifies StepMania 5 stepcharts with BPM changes
    so they scroll at a constant rate,
    even when played using an x-mod or m-mod.
    It calculates a target reading bpm
    based on the max DISPLAYBPM if present,
    or max BPM otherwise,
    and then applies SCROLL changes
    so slower BPM segments all scroll at that target reading speed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that this tool does not account for
    STOPS, SPEEDS, DELAYS, or WARPS.
    If your chart contains those,
    they will still be present in the output
    and will still affect your chart's scroll behavior.
