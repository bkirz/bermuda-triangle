This is the source code for https://bermudatriangle.tech, a collection of tools for use with
StepMania simfiles.

## Development
The core webapp is built using Flask and uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) for dependency management.
To run it locally:
```
# install dependencies (you may need to install poetry first)
$ poetry install

# start flask
$ poetry run flask run
```
