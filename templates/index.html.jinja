<h1>Upload a .ssc file to normalize its scroll rate!</h1>

<p>
This tiny tool modifies StepMania 5 stepcharts with BPM changes so they scroll at a constant rate, even when played using an x-mod or m-mod.
It calculates a target reading bpm based on the max DISPLAYBPM if present, or max BPM otherwise, and then applies SCROLL changes so slower BPM
segments all scroll at that target reading speed.
</p>
<p>
Note that this tool does not account for STOPS, SPEEDS, DELAYS, or WARPS. If your chart contains those, they will still be present in the output and
will still affect your chart's scroll behavior.
